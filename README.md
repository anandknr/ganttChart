# ganttChart
A sample Ganttchart with highcharts plugin

Please navigate to path https://localhost/highcharts/index.php/jQueryTest/index to see the Jquery implemented ganttchart implementation. Here, for each project selection, a sepearte server call is made and json data is returned.

With this example, one can learn - 
1. how to use highcharts with codeigniter (seperating out view from controller logic)
2. how to make jQuery server call to get json data (like ajax)
